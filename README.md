## Description
 Welcome to my first ever coding project. Python was the first coding language that I learned and this was the project that I worked on after my course to practice my basic python skills. I plan to keep improving and create more advanced projects in the future.

## Hangman
This hangman game randomly selects a word from a choice 854 dictionary words. The user is able to play the game in the terminal.
## To-Do
I plan to add a nicer GUI for the user to play the game in a different window than their code editor or terminal
